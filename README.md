# TDA Wildfire Simulation Project (A Topology-Based Framework for Assessing the Statistical Robustness of Multi-Layer Coastal Infrastructures)
This TDA project is an interactive Shiny application designed to analyze the impact of wildfires on electrical power grid infrastructure in the western United States. This tool combines geospatial analysis, network science, and topological data analysis (TDA) to assess grid vulnerability and resilience under wildfire conditions, it has been refactored and updated into a modular structure to improve code organization, maintainability, and readability.

## Important Disclaimers
### Known Limitations and Issues

#### Incomplete Features
- **Data Coverage**: Wildfire data may not cover all years or all geographic regions
- **Real-time Data**: Application uses historical data only; no real-time fire tracking
- **Grid Model**: Power grid model is simplified and may not reflect actual operational constraints
- **Performance**: Large-scale analyses may be slow or memory-intensive

#### Known Issues

1. **Memory Leaks**
   - Long-running sessions may consume increasing memory
   - **Workaround**: Restart the app periodically for extended analysis sessions
     
2. **Parallel Processing Warnings**
   - May see warnings about future/parallel processing on some systems
   - **Impact**: Usually harmless but may affect performance
   - **Workaround**: Check console for specific errors; most can be ignored
     
3. **Map Rendering**
   - Leaflet map may occasionally fail to render properly on first load
   - **Workaround**: Refresh the page or restart the app
     
4. **Large Fire Events**
   - Very large fire perimeters (>100,000 acres) may cause visualization slowdowns
   - **Workaround**: Adjust analysis radius or filter to smaller fire events
     
5. **TDA Computation Time**
   - Topological data analysis can be computationally expensive
   - Large networks may take several minutes to analyze
   - **Workaround**: Be patient; progress is shown in the R console
     
6. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Best performance in Chrome or Firefox
   - Safari may have occasional rendering issues with complex maps
   - **Workaround**: Use Chrome or Firefox for best experience
     
7. **Data File Paths**
   - Application assumes specific directory structure for data files
   - **Workaround**: Verify `global.R` configuration matches your file locations
     
8. **Compound Fire Analysis**
   - Analysis of multiple simultaneous fires is experimental
   - Results may be less stable than single-fire analysis
   - **Workaround**: Use with caution; verify results carefully
     
9. **Error Handling**
   - Some edge cases may produce cryptic error messages
   - **Workaround**: Check R console for detailed error information; restart app if needed
     
10. **Session State**
    - Browser refresh will reset all analysis progress
    - **Workaround**: Use download buttons to save results before refreshing

### Making Changes

When making changes to the application:

- Identify the right module - Find which module contains the function you need to modify
- Edit the module - Make your changes in the appropriate module file
- Test thoroughly - Ensure your changes don't break functionality in dependent modules
- Update documentation - Add comments explaining your changes

---

### Notes
The original WildfireServer.R file is preserved and fully functional, but i would NOT use it, as its incredibly cluttered with multiple functions and features jammed into one file, making it 4000+ lines.
 - All functionality is maintained that WildfireServer.R had the modular files have, 
 - The modular structure uses identical logic, just reorganized for clarity, but both versions can coexist in the same directory
